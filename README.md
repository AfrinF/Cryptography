# Cryptography Assignment
The code is implemented for colour Image and Black white Image.

Curve used:
-------------
# Eliptic curve parameters
a=71264358
b=2672718120
p=3472812659

# Base point co-ordinates
gx=1090012128
gy=2391085776

Steps involved :
-----------------

1. Converting the pixels to GF(p) range
2. Applying the Chaotic map
3. ECC based encryption
4. PSNR and MSE verification
5. ECC based decryption
6. Chaotic map inversion
7. PSNR and MSE verification
